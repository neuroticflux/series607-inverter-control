# series607-inverter-control
Remote control a Series 607 inverter (Kjell &amp; Co/LuxorParts) with Arduino

For now there's not much here except a simple Arduino sketch. To build this you also need a simple circuit consisting of two BJTs and two resistors and a cable with an RJ12 connector at one end.

TODO: Schematics and cable pinout

TODO: Modbus communication

TODO: Victron VenusOS integration using ModbusRTU (getting somewhat conflicting results from Victron's forums re whether it's even possible, but there's some good examples on the VenusOS drive in /opt/victronenergy/dbus-modbus-client/ which indicate it should be possible.
